# Genomic_Interval_Siumlator
Simulate CNV-like intervals at randomly generated loci across an arbitrary length genomic segment. The program generates a specified number of samples ('cells') to mimic technical and biological varation that is typical of bionformatic approaches to determine interval start and stop sites.
